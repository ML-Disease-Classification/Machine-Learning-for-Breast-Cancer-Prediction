# Machine-Learning-for-Breast-Cancer-Prediction
This repository is for Team 1's project on machine learning application for breast cancer prediction.
This project aims to evaluate machine learning models to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The goal is to compare several supervised classifiers (for example, logistic regression, SVM, decision tree, random forest, and Naive Bayes), identify which performs best under reliable validation, and interpret which features contribute most to predictions.
