	abstract = {In 2020, the World Health Organization reported that breast cancer resulted in the deaths of 685,000 people worldwide, with 2.3 million women diagnosed with the disease. Breast cancer is the most common cancer globally, with 7.8 million women diagnosed in the past five years. Machine learning (ML) techniques can help identify breast cancer early and define its type by analyzing tumor size. ML models have been used for image classification and cancer prediction, and have been shown to be beneficial for breast cancer diagnosis. The current systematic review aims to highlight the gaps and shortcomings of previous works regarding the use of ML for breast cancer prediction based on image processing. The review updates publications to see the pros and cons of various ML and deep learning (DL) techniques, and can benefit medical practitioners seeking advanced therapies. The previous works mainly benefited from SVM, KNN, and DT in detecting BC; however, other techniques, especially the DL ones, can be useful.},

	abstract = {Machine learning in the medical area has become a very important requirement. The healthcare professional needs useful tools to diagnose medical illnesses. Classiﬁers are important to provide tools that can be useful to the health professional for this purpose. However, questions arise: which classiﬁer to use? What metrics are appropriate to measure the performance of the classiﬁer? How to determine a good distribution of the data so that the classiﬁer does not bias the medical patterns to be classiﬁed in a particular class? Then most important question: does a classiﬁer perform well for a particular disease? This paper will present some answers to the questions mentioned above, making use of classiﬁcation algorithms widely used in machine learning research with datasets relating to medical illnesses under the supervised learning scheme. In addition to state-of-the-art algorithms in pattern classiﬁcation, we introduce a novelty: the use of meta-learning to determine, a priori, which classiﬁer would be the ideal for a speciﬁc dataset. The results obtained show numerically and statistically that there are reliable classiﬁers to suggest medical diagnoses. In addition, we provide some insights about the expected performance of classiﬁers for such a task.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study explores the feasibility of using machine learning to predict accurate versus inaccurate diagnoses made by pathologists based on their spatiotemporal viewing behavior when evaluating digital breast biopsy images. Materials and Methods: The study gathered data from 140 pathologists of varying experience levels who each reviewed a set of 14 digital whole slide images of breast biopsy tissue. Pathologists’ viewing behavior, including zooming and panning actions, was recorded during image evaluation. A total of 30 features were extracted from the viewing behavior data, and 4 machine learning algorithms were used to build classifiers for predicting diagnostic accuracy.
Results: The Random Forest classifier demonstrated the best overall performance, achieving a test accuracy of 0.81 and area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve of 0.86. Features related to attention distribution and focus on critical regions of interest were found to be important predictors of diagnostic accuracy. Further including case-level and pathologist-level information incrementally improved classifier performance. Discussion: Results suggest that pathologists’ viewing behavior during digital image evaluation can be leveraged to predict diagnostic accuracy, affording automated feedback and decision support systems based on viewing behavior to aid in training and, ultimately, clinical practice. They also carry implications for basic research examining the interplay between perception, thought, and action in diagnostic decision-making.
Conclusion: The classifiers developed herein have potential applications in training and clinical settings to provide timely feedback and support to pathologists during diagnostic decision-making.

	abstract = {In bioinformatics, the integration of machine learning has revolutionized disease diagnosis. Machine learning algorithms remove human limitations, offering more accuracy in diagnosing diseases like cancer. Breast cancer, the second most diagnosed cancer in women, often relies on mammography, which is only 70 \% accurate, leading to potential misdiagnosis. Biopsies, though more reliable, are subject to human error and conflicting specialist opinions, often requiring multiple biopsies. The shortage of pathologists further complicates accurate and timely diagnoses. Machine learning can reduce these errors, providing faster and more precise results. In this study, a breast cancer dataset with 11 features is analyzed using eight machine learning classifiers. Results showed that Logistic Regression achieved the highest testing accuracy of 91.67 \% without feature selection. After applying feature selection, classifiers like LGBM improved, with a notable 90.74 \% accuracy. This study highlights the importance of integrating machine learning into healthcare, not only for breast cancer but for other diseases like heart disease and diabetes. Continued exploration and application of machine learning in bioinformatics will enhance its accessibility and effectiveness for medical professionals worldwide, leading to improved patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common cause of death for women worldwide. Thus, the ability of artiﬁcial intelligence systems to detect possible breast cancer is very important. In this paper, an ensemble classiﬁcation mechanism is proposed based on a majority voting mechanism. First, the performance of different state-of-the-art machine learning classiﬁcation algorithms were evaluated for the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD). The three best classiﬁers were then selected based on their F3 score. F3 score is used to emphasize the importance of false negatives (recall) in breast cancer classiﬁcation. Then, these three classiﬁers, simple logistic regression learning, support vector machine learning with stochastic gradient descent optimization and multilayer perceptron network, are used for ensemble classiﬁcation using a voting mechanism. We also evaluated the performance of hard and soft voting mechanism. For hard voting, majority-based voting mechanism was used and for soft voting we used average of probabilities, product of probabilities, maximum of probabilities and minimum of probabilities-based voting methods. The hard voting (majority-based voting) mechanism shows better performance with 99.42\%, as compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm for WBCD.},

The former, however, typically requires the interpretation of complex multiple biomarker datasets to arrive at an informative diagnostic outcome. This report describes a machine learning (ML)-based classification workflow that is intended as a template for researchers seeking to apply ML approaches for developing host-based infectious disease biomarker classifiers. As an example, we built a classification model that could accurately distinguish between three disease etiology classes: bacterial, viral, and normal in human sera using host protein biomarkers of known diagnostic utility. After collecting protein data from known disease samples, we trained a series of increasingly complex Auto-ML models until arriving at an optimized classifier that could differentiate viral, bacterial, and non-disease samples. Even when limited to a relatively small training set size, the model had robust diagnostic characteristics and performed well when faced with a blinded sample set. We present here a flexible approach for applying an Auto-ML-based workflow for the identification of host biomarker classifiers with diagnostic utility for infectious disease, and which can readily be adapted for multiple biomarker classes and disease states.},

Its incidence and mortality rates are continuously rising. In recent years, with the rapid advancement of deep learning (DL) technology, DL has demonstrated significant potential in breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and treatment response prediction. This paper reviews relevant research progress and applies DL models to image enhancement, segmentation, and classification based on large-scale datasets from TCGA and multiple centers. We employed foundational models such as ResNet50, Transformer, and Hover-net to investigate the performance of DL models in breast cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis prediction. The results indicate that DL techniques have significantly improved diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, particularly in predicting breast cancer metastasis and clinical prognosis. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the crucial role of robust databases in developing highly generalizable models. Future research will focus on addressing challenges related to data management, model interpretability, and regulatory compliance, ultimately aiming to provide more precise clinical treatment and prognostic evaluation programs for breast cancer patients.},

Machine learning algorithms remove human limitations, offering more accuracy in diagnosing diseases like cancer. Breast cancer, the second most diagnosed cancer in women, often relies on mammography, which is only 70 \% accurate, leading to potential misdiagnosis. Biopsies, though more reliable, are subject to human error and conflicting specialist opinions, often requiring multiple biopsies. The shortage of pathologists further complicates accurate and timely diagnoses. Machine learning can reduce these errors, providing faster and more precise results. In this study, a breast cancer dataset with 11 features is analyzed using eight machine learning classifiers. Results showed that Logistic Regression achieved the highest testing accuracy of 91.67 \% without feature selection. After applying feature selection, classifiers like LGBM improved, with a notable 90.74 \% accuracy. This study highlights the importance of integrating machine learning into healthcare, not only for breast cancer but for other diseases like heart disease and diabetes. Continued exploration and application of machine learning in bioinformatics will enhance its accessibility and effectiveness for medical professionals worldwide, leading to improved patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common cause of death for women worldwide. Thus, the ability of artiﬁcial intelligence systems to detect possible breast cancer is very important. In this paper, an ensemble classiﬁcation mechanism is proposed based on a majority voting mechanism. First, the performance of different state-of-the-art machine learning classiﬁcation algorithms were evaluated for the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD). The three best classiﬁers were then selected based on their F3 score. F3 score is used to emphasize the importance of false negatives (recall) in breast cancer classiﬁcation. Then, these three classiﬁers, simple logistic regression learning, support vector machine learning with stochastic gradient descent optimization and multilayer perceptron network, are used for ensemble classiﬁcation using a voting mechanism. We also evaluated the performance of hard and soft voting mechanism. For hard voting, majority-based voting mechanism was used and for soft voting we used average of probabilities, product of probabilities, maximum of probabilities and minimum of probabilities-based voting methods. The hard voting (majority-based voting) mechanism shows better performance with 99.42\%, as compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm for WBCD.},

	abstract = {In recent years, infectious disease diagnosis has increasingly turned to host-centered approaches as a complement to pathogen-directed ones. The former, however, typically requires the interpretation of complex multiple biomarker datasets to arrive at an informative diagnostic outcome. This report describes a machine learning (ML)-based classification workflow that is intended as a template for researchers seeking to apply ML approaches for developing host-based infectious disease biomarker classifiers. As an example, we built a classification model that could accurately distinguish between three disease etiology classes: bacterial, viral, and normal in human sera using host protein biomarkers of known diagnostic utility. After collecting protein data from known disease samples, we trained a series of increasingly complex Auto-ML models until arriving at an optimized classifier that could differentiate viral, bacterial, and non-disease samples. Even when limited to a relatively small training set size, the model had robust diagnostic characteristics and performed well when faced with a blinded sample set. We present here a flexible approach for applying an Auto-ML-based workflow for the identification of host biomarker classifiers with diagnostic utility for infectious disease, and which can readily be adapted for multiple biomarker classes and disease states.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor among women worldwide and remains one of the leading causes of death among women. Its incidence and mortality rates are continuously rising. In recent years, with the rapid advancement of deep learning (DL) technology, DL has demonstrated significant potential in breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and treatment response prediction. This paper reviews relevant research progress and applies DL models to image enhancement, segmentation, and classification based on large-scale datasets from TCGA and multiple centers. We employed foundational models such as ResNet50, Transformer, and Hover-net to investigate the performance of DL models in breast cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis prediction. The results indicate that DL techniques have significantly improved diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, particularly in predicting breast cancer metastasis and clinical prognosis. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the crucial role of robust databases in developing highly generalizable models. Future research will focus on addressing challenges related to data management, model interpretability, and regulatory compliance, ultimately aiming to provide more precise clinical treatment and prognostic evaluation programs for breast cancer patients.},

The complexity of the different disease mechanisms and underlying symptoms of the patient population presents massive challenges in developing the early diagnosis tool and effective treatment. Machine learning (ML), an area of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI), enables researchers, physicians, and patients to solve some of these issues. Based on relevant research, this review explains how machine learning (ML) is being used to help in the early identiﬁcation of numerous diseases. Initially, a bibliometric analysis of the publication is carried out using data from the Scopus and Web of Science (WOS) databases. The bibliometric study of 1216 publications was undertaken to determine the most proliﬁc authors, nations, organizations, and most cited articles. The review then summarizes the most recent trends and approaches in machine-learning-based disease diagnosis (MLBDD), considering the following factors: algorithm, disease types, data type, application, and evaluation metrics. Finally, in this paper, we highlight key results and provides insight into future trends and opportunities in the MLBDD area.},

The current systematic review aims to highlight the gaps and shortcomings of previous works regarding the use of ML for breast cancer prediction based on image processing. The review updates publications to see the pros and cons of various ML and deep learning (DL) techniques, and can benefit medical practitioners seeking advanced therapies.

	abstract = {Machine learning in the medical area has become a very important requirement. The healthcare professional needs useful tools to diagnose medical illnesses. Classiﬁers are important to provide tools that can be useful to the health professional for this purpose. However, questions arise: which classiﬁer to use? What metrics are appropriate to measure the performance of the classiﬁer? How to determine a good distribution of the data so that the classiﬁer does not bias the medical patterns to be classiﬁed in a particular class? Then most important question: does a classiﬁer perform well for a particular disease? This paper will present some answers to the questions mentioned above, making use of classiﬁcation algorithms widely used in machine learning research with datasets relating to medical illnesses under the supervised learning scheme. In addition to state-of-the-art algorithms in pattern classiﬁcation, we introduce a novelty: the use of meta-learning to determine, a priori, which classiﬁer would be the ideal for a speciﬁc dataset. The results obtained show numerically and statistically that there are reliable classiﬁers to suggest medical diagnoses. In addition, we provide some insights about the expected performance of classiﬁers for such a task.},
